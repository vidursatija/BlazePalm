# BlazePalm

BlazeFace is a fast, light-weight face detector from Google Research. [Read more](https://sites.google.com/view/perception-cv4arvr/blazeface), [Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05047)

A pretrained model is available as part of Google's [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/docs/face_detection_mobile_gpu.md) framework.

Besides a bounding box, BlazeFace also predicts 6 keypoints for face landmarks (2x eyes, 2x ears, nose, mouth).

Because BlazeFace is designed for use on mobile devices, the pretrained model is in TFLite format. However, I wanted to use it in **CoreML** and not *TensorFlow*. 

> **NOTE:** The MediaPipe model is slightly different from the model described in the BlazeFace paper. It uses depthwise convolutions with a 3x3 kernel, not 5x5. And it only uses "single" BlazeBlocks, not "double" ones.

The BlazePaper paper mentions that there are two versions of the model, one for the front-facing camera and one for the back-facing camera. This repo includes only the frontal camera model, as that is the only one I was able to find an official trained version for. The difference between the two models is the dataset they were trained on. As the paper says,

> For the frontal camera model, only faces that occupy more than 20% of the image area were considered due to the intended use case (the threshold for the rear-facing camera model was 5%).

This means the included model will not be able to detect faces that are relatively small. It's really intended for selfies, not for general-purpose face detection.

## Inside this repo

Essential ML files:

- **ML/blazeface.py**: defines the `BlazeFace` class that does all the work

- **ML/blazeface.pth**: the weights for the trained model

- **ML/anchors.npy**: lookup table with anchor boxes

ML Notebooks:

- **ML/GenAnchors.ipynb**: creates anchor boxes and saves them as a binary file (ML/anchors.npy)

- **ML/Convert2PyTorch.ipynb**: loads the weights from the TFLite model and converts them to PyTorch format (ML/blazeface.pth)

- **ML/InferencePyTorch.ipynb**: shows how to use the `BlazeFace` class to make face detections

- **ML/coremlconv.py**: loads the weights from the PyTorch model and converts them to CoreML format

## Detections

### CoreML

Each face detection has 8 SIMD2 vectors(landmarks) and 1 Float number(confidence):

- The first 4 numbers describe the bounding box corners: 
    - `xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax`

- The next 12 numbers are the x,y-coordinates of the 6 facial landmark keypoints:
    - `right_eye_x, right_eye_y`
    - `left_eye_x, left_eye_y`
    - `nose_x, nose_y`
    - `mouth_x, mouth_y`
    - `right_ear_x, right_ear_y`
    - `left_ear_x, left_ear_y`
    - Tip: these labeled as seen from the perspective of the person, so their right is your left.

- These are normalized coordinates (between 0 and 1).

- SIMD2 is used for faster vector math.

- The final number is the confidence score that this detection really is a face.

### PyTorch

Each face detection is a PyTorch `Tensor` consisting of 17 numbers:

- The first 4 numbers describe the bounding box corners: 
    - `ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax`
    - These are normalized coordinates (between 0 and 1).

- The next 12 numbers are the x,y-coordinates of the 6 facial landmark keypoints:
    - `right_eye_x, right_eye_y`
    - `left_eye_x, left_eye_y`
    - `nose_x, nose_y`
    - `mouth_x, mouth_y`
    - `right_ear_x, right_ear_y`
    - `left_ear_x, left_ear_y`
    - Tip: these labeled as seen from the perspective of the person, so their right is your left.

- The final number is the confidence score that this detection really is a face.
